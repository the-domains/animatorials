"Oh no! Here comes Mr. Stinky." I know that's what you and your friends say whenever I approach. How do you think that makes me feel?

Why does my odor always have to be the thing that defines me? Skunks have other, positive attributes, you know. We're clever. We're good with tools. Ever consider those things when one of us is heading over? Ever say to yourself, "Here comes a skunk. Fantastic! I'll bet he can help me build these bookshelves!" No, you probably think, "Darn, he's gonna contaminate my wood. The bookshelves are gonna smell like wet shoes now."

There are a lot of things worse than the smell of a skunk. Ever take a whiff of a sumo wrestler's gym bag or the porto-potties at a state fair? Ever been to Savannah on a Friday night in August? Look, I'm not saying skunks don't have an odor problem. I'm just saying let's put it in perspective, maybe look beyond it for once.

We have feelings too.
