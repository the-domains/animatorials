Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. Usually a day that is associated with the wholesale slaughter of your species would fall low on someoneʼs list of favorite holidays. But not mine. I choose to see the glass as half full. Iʼm an optimist. Thanksgiving forces turkey rafters to spend quality time together. Knowing any member of your family might not be there in the morning, having been grabbed before dawn, their head sliced off with the blade of a rusty axe, encourages you to cherish each moment. It brings urgency to say what we have to say to the ones we love. 

Something that makes you live as if each day was the last, well, how can that be a bad thing? The truth is all of us can die at any time - drunk drivers, planes falling from the sky... At least turkeys have a clue when death might come. Think of all those poor rodents who died crossing the road and now sit in heaven with unfinished business. If I had to pick one thing that helps me keep my weight down, itʼs Thanksgiving. The fatter you are, the higher your risk of saying goodbye. Iʼll take Thanksgiving over Atkins any day. 

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Thatʼs my motto. Like a said, Iʼm an optimist.
