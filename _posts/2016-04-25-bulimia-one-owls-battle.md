written by Douglas (owl)

I am bulimic. I am not proud of this but I feel that I need to openly admit it to help myself and for the betterment of owls everywhere. Iʼm not sure how it started and I am not pointing any wings. It could have been the pressures of our society to stay thin. Or maybe it was always being called the ʻfat birdʼ of the parliament...I donʼt know.

Last week I caught my reflection in the pond and I hated it. In fact, I was disgusted by it. When did that healthy, strong, Great Horned Owl turn into this pathetic pigeon-looking thing (no offense, pigeon friends)? My plumage was thinning, my eyes were vacant, and heck, I can barely muster enough strength to hold a field mouse in my beak (no offense to field mice). Want proof that I hit rock bottom? I started sleeping at night!

Look, I know sticking talons down my beak is wrong, but I canʼt help myself. If I eat a frog, rodent, or snake I want to keep it down. Out of respect. I donʼt want to waste you. So, please, if any of you have some advice I would really appreciate it.
