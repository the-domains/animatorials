Nature's Miracle removes pet odors from carpets and upholstery. Itʼs a good product but letʼs be honest, what it does - not really a miracle. 

Iʼm not saying removing urine odor is easy. But doing something the rest of us canʼt do doesnʼt automatically elevate it to miracle status. According to Wikipedia, a miracle is a "divine intervention by God in the Universe by which the ordinary course and operation of Nature is overruled, suspended, or modified."; In other words, turning water into wine or raising the dead. Maybe even getting all those clowns into one car. But pouring something onto cat piss and making the room no longer smell like cat piss? Sorry. Application for sainthood rejected. 

You donʼt have to be a believer to know that Jesus is considered the number one miracle worker. Heʼs like the Michael Jordan of Unexplained Stuff. So you would think that if removing pet odors was worthy of miracle status, Jesus would have done that too, right? After all, he did all the other stuff. Doesnʼt the fact that Jesus DIDNʼT get rid of animal piss smells tell us something about its lack of status as a miraculous endeavor? Nowhere in the bible does it say, "And Jesus pourth the liquid onto the urine and it was good." 

Calling it Natureʼs Miracle cheapens real miracles. I urge you to write to the company and suggest they change the name to something less provocative like Natureʼs Cool Trick or Natureʼs Thing That YOU Canʼt Do; Feel free to come up with your own. These are just suggestions. 

And for the record, I will be writing to the Miracle Whip people next.
