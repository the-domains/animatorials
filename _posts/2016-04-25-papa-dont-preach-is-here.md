written by Papa don't Preach (horse)

Hello, ladies. How are you all today? 

We all know why Iʼm here. I believe the word is stud but I imagine you figured that out when you saw me walk in, am I right? Man, they said thereʼd be mares in here but they didnʼt say anything about foxes. Damn! 

Maybe youʼve heard of me, "Papa Donʼt Preach"? Iʼve been kickinʼ around the big tracks a few years now. Made some folks a few duckets here and there - won a few, placed a few, had a lot of shows... You know what Iʼm sayinʼ. Apparently someone likes the makeup inside this smooth, brown coat because, well, here I am baby. 

So here we are, face to face with nothing but horseshoes. Ohhh yeahh. Let me go get a robe and some hay and Iʼll be right back to get this thing started. By the way, even through weʼre working for The Man thereʼs no rule against enjoying ourselves.
