I donʼt believe in god. Notice the small "g." Like other self-described atheists, I reject supernatural claims because they lack empirical evidence to support the existence of such deities. Heʼs an all-knowing entity who lives in the sky, you say? 

Sounds like fairy tales to me. Being a fox, I know about fairy tales. Iʼm in some.

When youʼre being chased down for slaughter by a large collection of hounds, horses and Englishman it is hard to wrap oneʼs mind around the concept of a just and kind god. (Did you notice the small "g" this time?) Sure, He loves all his creatures. He just happens to work in mysterious ways and has decided that today it would be best if the foxes were to scamper through bushes in a desperate attempt to save their lives. Sorry. Doesnʼt pass the smell test.

There is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere. Indeed atheistic thought has become intertwined with broader philosophies such as Objectivism and logical positivism. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. But Iʼm sure Iʼm not telling you anything you donʼt already know.

The simple fact is, I believe what I believe and, until I see otherwise, Iʼm not going to change my mind. Now if youʼll excuse me, I think I hear barking. Time to run for my life.
