How come herring has never been the Fish of the Day? What are we, chopped liver? I bet chopped liver gets to be Fish of the Day before we do. What's it say about the menu industry when a non-fish is gonna beat out a fish to be Fish Of The Day? 

Something doesn't smell right, that's what it says. And when a fish says that, you should listen. The first time doesn't have to be a whole 24 hours. Fish Of The Afternoon would be fine. We just want a shot to prove ourselves. People like herring. Just because we're not as popular as tuna or salmon that shouldn't disqualify us. Look at BMW. More people buy Fords but you don' see BMW dealers complaining. Not a perfect analogy but you get my point. And consider this: we're high in potassium. What about that? Huh? It's time to give herring a chance. I guarantee we're going to surprise you. Remember the Titanic? Nobody thought she'd sink but she did, didn't she? Again, not a perfect analogy but you get my point.
