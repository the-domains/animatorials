For years I worked for GlaxoSmithKline in their research division. When it was discovered I had developed liver cancer, I figured the gig was up. I assumed theyʼd give me a small severance and send me home to "get my affairs in order." Boy, was I wrong!

The caring folks at GlaxoSmithKline set up a research lab, hired the top scientists in the world and poured tens (maybe hundreds!) of millions of dollars into finding a cure. For me! And they did it knowing full well thereʼs no way Iʼll ever be able to pay them back. That, my friends, is called taking care of your employees.

Granted, I got the cancer from them in the first place but why point fingers? Hey, mistakes happen. You store the Thorium pellets next to the mouse food... Lesson learned. The point is, management at GlaxoSmithKline took responsibility. When it became clear no other company had a cure for liver cancer, they dug in and worked to find a cure themselves. They decided that money is not the most important thing. The most important thing is fixing what you break.

Say what you want about corporations being soulless. This one saved my life.
